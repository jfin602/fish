# Documentation index

Start at [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and [BOOT.md](../BOOT.md), then follow only the routes needed for the task. P0 is qualified on Linux/X11; P1 is in progress; P2 underwater-world planning is selected but not executed.

## Current sequence

P1 still owns final movement acceptance. After actual P1 close, prepare the deliberate `0.2.0` baseline and execute [P2 worldbuilding](tasks/p2/README.md). P2 establishes the habitat and underwater presentation before P3 ecology. The previously selected Movement abilities remain a future enhancement rather than the next roadmap Phase.

## Status language

- **Confirmed:** accepted by the owner.
- **Working design:** a proposed mechanism used to make a selected task concrete.
- **Implemented:** present in source, with the actual boundary described.
- **Observed/qualified:** supported by identified source, scenario and tool/platform evidence.
- **Open:** a consequential decision remains unresolved.
